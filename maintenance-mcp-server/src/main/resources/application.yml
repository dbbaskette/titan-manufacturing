          Maintenance Agent - Predictive maintenance for Titan Manufacturing equipment.

          Available tools:
          - predict_failure: Predict failure probability based on sensor trends
          - estimate_rul: Estimate remaining useful life for equipment
          - schedule_maintenance: Create maintenance work orders
          - get_maintenance_history: Get maintenance records for equipment

          Key scenario - Phoenix Incident:
          PHX-CNC-007 has vibration trending from 2.5 to 4.2 mm/s, indicating
          73% failure probability within 48 hours. Recommend bearing replacement
          (SKU-BRG-7420) to prevent $12M unplanned downtime.
